At The Prospect KC’s 1st Annual Gumbo Festival! The family-friendly outdoor festival will bring together friends and neighborhoods in Kansas City's Historic 18th & Vine Jazz District. Not only are we enrolling many teams to dazzle our taste buds with secret recipes, but also hosting James Beard-nominated celebrity Chefs from across the country who will award the winners according to the excellence of dishes made using traditional ingredients.  This festival will feature live music, cocktails, a personal bowl of gumbo, food trucks, local vendors and yard games!! 

The festival proceeds will be invested in The Prospect KC’s mission to empower individuals and communities through food-based solutions, by building transferable skills, creating employment opportunities, social supports and developing nutrition education programming. As a community-minded nonprofit, we rely on the generosity of sponsors like you to make our work possible.  With your help, we can continue our work to make sure no one goes hungry or is denied the opportunity for self-determination because of hunger.
